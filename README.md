The .Rmd file is where the code is to examine any possible data issues.

## Part 4

One of the main questions I have is how this data is collected. The brands and receipts datasets that were provided had a large amount of data missing for some columns, which is a little concerning. There is also a lot of duplicated rows within the users dataset. This may be due to the fact that as the user logs in again, a new record is created. The problem then would be that it's saving the new log in date over the old record while creating a new record. For both of these, I looked quick to see if the total rows in the dataset was equal to the distinct rows within the dataset. The other two tables didn't look to have duplicated rows.
